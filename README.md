# Dithcord

Dithcord is a **WORK IN PROGRESS** library for Discord Bots. And by WIP I mean, it's fairly useless right now and is in heavy development. In other words, don't download it.

> If you're wondering about the name, it's because Dithcord is built on Clojure, which is a *lisp*. Yes, I think it's a clever pun. No, I don't think it's ableist to joke about lisps. No more than the fact that the word itself is pronounced `lithp` if you have it. Thanks for the name, Jagrosh!
